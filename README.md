## ✅ Experiment 5A: Odd or Even

**AIM:**
To write a C++ program to check whether a number entered by the user is even or odd.

**THEORY:**
This program uses the modulus operator (`%`) to determine if a number is divisible by 2. If a number gives a remainder of 0 when divided by 2, it is even; otherwise, it is odd. The program uses `if-else` conditions and takes an integer input from the user using `cin`.

**CONCLUSION:**
The program was successfully executed. It correctly identified whether the entered number was even or odd. This exercise strengthened our understanding of modulus operator and conditional statements in C++.

## ✅ Experiment 5B: Vowel or Consonant

**AIM:**
To write a C++ program that checks whether the entered character is a vowel or consonant.

**THEORY:**
The program takes a single character as input and converts it to lowercase using the `tolower()` function. It then checks whether the character is a vowel (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`) using a series of OR (`||`) conditions. All other alphabetic characters are considered consonants.

**CONCLUSION:**
The program successfully determined whether the input character is a vowel or consonant. The use of `tolower()` made the program case-insensitive. This experiment helped reinforce character handling and logical operators in C++.

## ✅ Experiment 5C: Largest of Three Numbers

**AIM:**
To write a C++ program to find the largest of three numbers entered by the user.

**THEORY:**
The program uses `if-else-if` conditions to compare three numbers and determine the greatest among them. It also includes a check to see if all three numbers are equal using the `==` operator. Logical comparisons like `>=` are used to handle cases where numbers may be equal.

**CONCLUSION:**
The program correctly identified the largest number and handled all equal-number scenarios. This task improved understanding of logical comparisons and multi-branch decision making using `if-else`.

## ✅ Experiment 5D: Traffic Light Signal Meaning

**AIM:**
To write a C++ program that displays the action based on a traffic light color using switch-case.

**THEORY:**
The user is asked to enter a number corresponding to a traffic light color:

* 1 for Red
* 2 for Yellow
* 3 for Green

Using a `switch` statement, the program prints the appropriate action:

* Red → STOP
* Yellow → SLOW DOWN
* Green → GO

If the user enters a value outside 1–3, a default message is shown.

**CONCLUSION:**
The program executed correctly for all valid inputs and showed an error message for invalid ones. It demonstrated the use of `switch-case` for decision-making, which is cleaner and more efficient when dealing with fixed options.
